# Similar Image Search

### Objective
The overall goal of this project is to __provide a query image and find the closest image(s) in our database__. In other words, given an image and a library of images, retireve the closes K similar images to queried image. 


### Algorithm & Experiments 

In order to perform the similar inmage search, below are some of the algorithms used to determine which K images in the database is _similar_ to queried image. 



#### Requirements
Those new to python libraries, follow this guide to [install Keras + Tensorflow](https://keras.io/#installation) as both are needed if training a new model.
